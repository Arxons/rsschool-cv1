### Some words about Myself:
 
When some people are asked to say a few words about themselves, they often get confused and don't know what to answer.<br>
But that's not me. About myself I can say that my main goal is to learn and improve in the field of front-end development and everything connected with it.<br> 
I would like to mention my strengths. Such as responsibility and punctuality. These are not empty words.<br>
Once, when I was doing another project the customer tightened the deadline and I had to spend the whole night completing endless lines of code instead of just going to bed.<br>
I had never worked for any company before. I used to do orders from people I knew. Or did something for myself.<br>
